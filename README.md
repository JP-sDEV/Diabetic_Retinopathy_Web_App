# Diabetic Retinopathy Online Classifier

**Disclaimer**: I am not a professional nor licensed to diagnose/treat diabetic retinopathy. I am simply using machine learning to detect diabetic retinopathy based on it's physical features.

This web app predicts the severity of diabetic retinopathy given an image taken via Nonmydriatic digital retinal photography.
